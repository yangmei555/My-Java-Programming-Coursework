R10.5 Events

    The event objects are instances of classes that you must provide when handling events, the
    methods of the event listener classes contain the instructions that you want to have executed
    when the events occur.

    The event source is the user-interface component, such as a button, that generates a particular
    event.

    An event listener belongs to a class created by the application programmer. Its methods describe
    the actions to be taken when an event occurs.


R10.6 actionPerformed

    The event source. It occurs whenever the event occurs.


R10.11 Inner class and event-listeners

    There are two advantages of using inner classes: First, listener classes tend to be very short.
    You can put the inner class close to where it is needed, without cluttering up the remainder of
    the project. Moreover, inner classes have a very attractive feature: Their methods can access
    instance variables and methods of the surrounding class.

    Yes, we could. we could define the actionPerformed class inside our main class and use "this"
    to replace the inner class object.


R10.14 Object hierarchies

    The method append() is declared in JTextArea.It inherits getText() from JTextComponent. It inherits
    getWidth() from JComponent.


R10.22 Graphic methods

    Make the top-left coordinates and the width and height of the rectangle become variables so that
    they are changeable.


R11.2 Layout managers

    It is far more convenient to handle;


R11.11 ButtonGroup

    Because radio buttons are mutually exclusive, only one button in the group can be selected at
    any time. But the check boxs are not.


R11.19 Types of Events

    MouseEvent is the parameter type for methods in MouseListener and handls events caused by the
    mouse. ActionEvent is the parameter type for methods in ActionListener and handles events caused
    by clicking the buttons.


R11.20 Events

    The action event contains the information about when the event happens, what kind of event it
    is, and so on. The mouse event contains other more information such as the X and Y coordinators
    of the location of the mouse.


R11.21 ActionListener versus MouseListener

    The ActionListener should only detect one state of the event, that is, whether the button is
    clicked or not. But the mouse has lots of states, pressed or not pressed, released or not
    released, clicked or not clicked, and so on. So the MouseListener needs more methods to handle
    all these situations.
