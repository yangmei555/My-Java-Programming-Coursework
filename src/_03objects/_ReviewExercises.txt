R8.1 Encapsulation

    The process of providing a public interface, while hiding the implementation details, is called encapsulation.
    It is useful because encapsulation enables changes in the implementation without affecting users of a class.

R8.4 Public interface

    The method declarations and comments make up the public interface of the class. The data and the method bodies
    make up the private implementation of the class.

R8.7 Instance versus static

    An instance method is a method that can be invoked on the object of the class. You can access the instance
    variables of the class in the method body. But you can not access the instance variables of the class in the
    static method. Static method belongs to the class, not the objects.

R8.8 Mutator and accessor

    A mutator method modifies the object on which it operates.
    An accessor method queries the object for some information without changing it.

R8.9 Implicit parameter

    The object on which a method is applied is the implicit parameter.
    Explicit parameters of a method are listed in the method declaration.
    In Java, you do not actually write the implicit parameter in the method declaration.

R8.10 Implicit parameter

    Every instance method has exactly one implicit parameter and zero or more explicit parameters.
    A static method does't have implicit parameters.

R8.12 Constructors

    A class can have lots of constructors.
    Yes, you can. There is a default one.
    The compiler picks the constructor that matches the construction arguments.

R8.16 Instance variables

    The private word means that you can only access or modify the variable or method inside the class. Anything
    outside the class can not access or modify the private variables or methods.

R8.19 The this reference

    In a method, the this reference refers to the implicit parameter.
    You can use the this reference to make the program clear that some variables are instance variables and not
    local variables.

R8.20 Zero, null, false, empty String

    Number zero, the null reference, the value false, are the default values of number variables, reference variables,
    boolean variables. The empty string is a valid string of length 0, whereas a null indicates that a String variable
    refers to no string at all.
