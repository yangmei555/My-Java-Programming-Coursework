R13.1 Terms

    a. Recursion
    A recursive computation solves a problem by using the solution to the same problem with simpler
    inputs.

    b. Iteration
    Iteration is to use a for loop or a while loop to make the problem easier and easier and to
    solve the problem.

    c. Infinite recursion
    A method calling itself over and over with no end in sight.

    d. Recursive helper method
    A recursive helper method is to make a slight change to the original problem and to make it
    easier to to find a recursive solution.


R13.2 Smallest value

    Each time, take the first element of the input array, compare it with the smallest value of
    the remaining array, and take the smaller one as output. The base case is that when the array
    only remains two elements, return the smaller one.


R13.3 Sort array of numbers

    Each time, find the smallest value in the array using the way explained in R13.2, and exchange
    this smallest element with the first element in the array. Then remove the first element in the
    array and take the remaining array as input. The base case is that when the array only remains
    two elements, exchange them to guarantee that the smaller element is in front of the larger
    element.


R13.6 Exponents recursively

    Suppose function f(int n) is what we use to solve the problem.
    When i>=2, f(i) = f(i - 1) * x. If i equals to 1, return x.


R13.8 Factorial recursively

    Suppose function f(int n) is what we use to solve the problem.
    When i>=2, f(i) = f(i - 1) * i. If i equals to 1, return 1.
